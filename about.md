I am currently working at Mercari, Inc. as Machine Learning Engineer in Tokyo, Japan. My areas of interest include creating production grade distributed machine learning systems as well as research in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision & Speech Recognition. I am an alumni of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (batch of 2019) with bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. Feel free to contact me to have a chat.
