I am currently working at Mercari, Inc. as Machine Learning Engineer in Tokyo, Japan. I have strong background in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Speech Recognition and NLP. I am an alumni of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (batch of 2019) with bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I love coffee, talking about TV shows and creative use of technologies to make life easier.

## PUBLICATIONS

1. [**Data Driven Sensing for Action Recognition using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337488173_Data_Driven_Sensing_for_Action_Recognition_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks)  
*Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 11941. Springer, Cham // Dec 2019*
  - Developed a novel data-driven undersampling method using sub-pixel convolutional layers and integrated it with Inflated 3D ConvNet for action recognition
  - Successfully performed action recognition on both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets at multiple (including very high) under-sampling ratios with small drop in accuracy

2. [**Compressive Sensing Based Privacy for Fall Detection**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338188678_Compressive_sensing_based_privacy_for_fall_detection)  
*Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer // Dec 2019*
  - Developed a privacy preserving fall detection framework based on block based compressive sensing and deep learning which works with wide variety of sensing matrices

3. [**Artificial Neural Network based Controller Design for SMPS**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338356363_Artificial_Neural_Network_based_controller_design_for_SMPS)  
*IEEE Xplore Digital Library // Oct 2019*
  - Designed a controller using neural network for half-bridge converter based SMPS to replace conventional PID controllers

4. [**Few Shot Speaker Recognition using Deep Neural Networks**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332522436_Few_Shot_Speaker_Recognition_using_Deep_Neural_Networks)  
*Preprint // Apr 2019*
  - Developed a few shot speaker identification framework using deep convolutional neural networks with prototypical loss
  - Performed speaker identification and few shot speaker identification tasks on Voxceleb dataset using Capsule Network, VGG and ResNet34 architectures
  - Showed generalisation capability of the networks on both tasks by performing experiments on VCTK Corpus
